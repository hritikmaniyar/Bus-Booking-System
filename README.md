# Bus-Booking-System

This is a Bus Booking System project which contains:
1. A Home page where bus owners could add/register their buses in the portal and passengers could search for the respective buses and could also check their bookings status.
2. A Portal where bus owners could register/add their buses providing all the information travelling on different routes.
3. A Search bus page where passengers could enter source, destination and date to search for the respective buses.
4. A Bookings page where passengers could check their bookings status.
5. A Booking window where passenger could choose any bus from the list of buses available.
6. A Confirmation page where passenger needs to provide his/her name, contact number and number of seats to be reserved for confirming the booking.

This project also contains a database which has three tables:
1. Appointments - This table stores the data of buses registered along with relevant information.
2. Details - This table stores the data of the passenger who has booked ticket(s) along with his/her bus details.

Few buses that are already registered and added in the database include:
1. Verma Travels (From Gandhinagar to Jaipur)
2. Praveen Travels (From Bengaluru to Mangalore)
3. Mahadev Travels (From Chandigarh to Manali)
